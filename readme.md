# Virtual Food Ordering System



## About the Project

This project simulates a virtual food ordering system where users can select food items, place orders, and see their orders processed in real-time. With an intuitive user interface and promise-based asynchronous order handling, this system offers a realistic restaurant ordering experience.

## Features

- Intuitive, visually appealing user interface resembling a restaurant theme.
- Prominent **Order Food** button.
- Checkboxes for selecting multiple food items.
- Variety of food items to choose from.
- Users can select multiple items in one order.
- Simulates food preparation using a promise that resolves after a random number of seconds.
- Shows an image of the ordered food items in the center of the screen upon order completion.
- Displays a unique order ID in the top-right corner.
- Includes restaurant-themed design, animations, sound effects, and customized order numbers.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a themed restaurant experience.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactions, promise-based logic, and order processing.

## Working

1. **Food Selection**:
   - Users select one or more food items using checkboxes.
2. **Order Food**:
   - Clicking the **Order Food** button starts the ordering process.
   - A promise is initiated that resolves after a random number of seconds (simulating food preparation).
3. **Order Completion**:
   - While the promise is pending, a loading animation or message is displayed.
   - When the promise resolves, the ordered food items appear in the center of the screen.
   - A unique order ID is displayed in the top-right corner.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
